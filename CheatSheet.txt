<!-- Writing a draft -->

Below are the steps to writing a draft:

1.) Create a new .markdown file in _drafts with the following name: yyyy-mm-dd-title-of-article.markdown
2.) At the top of the document, provide the front matter (above) and text below it (see formatting above).
3.) Find high res image (approx 2000px wide) and add it to assets/images/hero
4.) Copy high res image into assets/images/thumbnails and edit it in photoshop to have a width of 350px
5.) (optional) Save any other photos wanted to add to body of blog under assets/images/posts
6.) Save the file and go to command prompt
7.) Under the correct directory, type 'jekyll serve --draft'
