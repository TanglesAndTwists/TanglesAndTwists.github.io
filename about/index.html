        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>From a young age I have always harbored the urge to create. Whether it be sewing homemade dresses, sketching out botanical drawings, or glazing endless pottery pieces  I've come to realize there is no greater sense of happiness than seeing a physical manifestation of my passion come to fruition.</p>

		<p>So, when I was first introduced to macram√© , I knew I wanted to try and make pieces that I could share with other people. The joy that I receive from creating wall hangings, purses, and everything in between is something that I knot into every part of my work. And as I start this new journey into blogging, I look forward bringing a little bit of happiness into the lives of my customers and followers!</p>
